# Connection Dialog Update - Removed Redundant Communication Tests

## Summary

Updated the connection dialog to remove redundant `test_communication()` calls that were happening immediately after successful `connect()` calls. This simplifies the code and eliminates unnecessary double-testing.

## What Changed

### Arduino Connection (`connect_arduino` method)
**Before:**
```python
if arduino.connect(port):
    if arduino.test_communication():  # ← REDUNDANT!
        # ... continue with setup
    else:
        # Handle communication failure
```

**After:**
```python
if arduino.connect(port):
    # Connection successful - communication already verified by connect()
    # ... continue with setup
```

### Scale Connection (`connect_scale` method)
**Before:**
```python
if scale.connect(port):
    if scale.test_communication():  # ← REDUNDANT!
        # ... continue
    else:
        # Handle communication failure
```

**After:**
```python
if scale.connect(port):
    # Connection successful - communication already verified
    # ... continue
```

## Why This Is Better

1. **No Redundancy**: The `connect()` method already tests communication internally. It won't return `True` unless communication is working.

2. **Simpler Code**: Removed unnecessary nested if statements and error handling for a condition that can't happen.

3. **Faster**: Eliminates an extra round-trip communication test, making connections slightly faster.

4. **Less Error-Prone**: Fewer code paths = fewer potential bugs.

## How connect() Works

Both Arduino and Scale controllers follow this pattern:

```python
def connect(self, port):
    # 1. Open serial port
    # 2. Configure settings
    # 3. Wait for device to stabilize
    # 4. TEST COMMUNICATION (send command, verify response)
    # 5. Only return True if everything works
```

Since step 4 already verifies communication, calling `test_communication()` again is pointless.

## Compatibility

For backward compatibility, the controllers still have `test_communication()` methods that simply return `is_connected()`. This prevents errors in any other code that might call these methods.

## Result

- Cleaner, more maintainable code
- Same functionality with less complexity
- No behavioral changes from user perspective
