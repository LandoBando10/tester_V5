# Serial Port Resource Conflict Fix Summary

## Problem
The application was experiencing "Permission error - may be Arduino R4" errors when refreshing ports in the connection dialog. This occurred because multiple components were trying to access the same serial port simultaneously:
- The preloader connected to Arduino during startup and kept the connection open
- The connection dialog tried to scan ALL ports, including already connected ones
- The port scanner didn't properly exclude connected ports from scanning

## Solution
Implemented a global port registry to track which serial ports are in use across the application.

### Changes Made:

1. **Created `src/services/port_registry.py`**
   - Singleton registry that tracks which ports are in use
   - Thread-safe with proper locking
   - Methods: `acquire_port()`, `release_port()`, `is_port_in_use()`, `get_ports_in_use()`

2. **Updated `src/hardware/serial_manager.py`**
   - Integrated with port registry
   - Before connecting: checks if port is already in use and tries to acquire it
   - After disconnecting: releases the port from registry
   - Improved error handling to distinguish between:
     - Port in use by our application
     - Port in use by another process
     - Arduino R4 specific permission issues

3. **Updated `src/services/port_scanner_service.py`**
   - `probe_port()` now skips ports that are already in use
   - Prevents scanning of ports that are actively connected

4. **Updated `src/gui/components/connection_dialog.py`**
   - Uses port registry to get ports in use
   - Excludes both connected ports and registry-tracked ports from scanning

5. **Updated `src/gui/main_window.py`**
   - Ensures preloaded Arduino/Scale connections are registered in the port registry
   - Prevents orphaned port locks when transferring connections

6. **Updated `src/services/connection_service.py`**
   - Added failsafe port registry cleanup in disconnect methods
   - Ensures ports are released even if controller disconnect fails

## Result
- No more permission errors when refreshing ports
- Proper tracking of which ports are in use
- Better error messages distinguishing between different types of connection failures
- Thread-safe port management across the application

## Testing
Created and ran a test script that verified:
- Port registry properly tracks port usage
- Multiple connection attempts to the same port are blocked
- SerialManager integration works correctly
- Ports are properly released after disconnection
