# Fast Startup Connection Implementation

## Overview
Optimize connection dialog and background port scanning to leverage existing preloader optimizations.

## Current State (Already Implemented)
✅ **Preloader connects during splash screen** - Arduino found and connected in <0.5s
✅ **Smart port ordering** - Last Arduino port cached and tried first
✅ **Connection transfer** - Pre-connected Arduino passed from preloader to MainWindow
✅ **No double scanning** - Ports are NOT scanned twice during startup
✅ **Device cache** - Stores last Arduino port and device info

## Actual Problems
- Connection Dialog doesn't use preloaded device information
- Remaining ports (scales, etc.) not scanned in background after Arduino found
- Manual port refresh rescans all ports from scratch
- No progressive UI updates during port scanning

## Implementation Tasks

### 1. ✅ COMPLETED - Preloader Fast Connection
**File:** `src/gui/startup/preloader.py`
- Already implements sequential scan with immediate connection
- Connects to Arduino and keeps connection open
- Passes connected controller via PreloadedComponents

### 2. Update Connection Dialog to Use Preloaded Data
**File:** `src/gui/components/connection_dialog.py`
- Check `PreloadedComponents` for already scanned ports
- Use cached device info instead of rescanning
- Only scan ports not already checked by preloader
- Show preloaded devices immediately in dropdown

### 3. ✅ COMPLETED - Smart Port Ordering
**File:** `src/hardware/serial_manager.py`
- Already loads last Arduino port from cache
- Prioritizes cached port during startup

### 4. Implement Background Port Completion
**File:** `src/gui/startup/preloader.py`
- After Arduino connection, scan remaining ports for scales/other devices
- Store all device info in PreloadedComponents
- Make full device list available to Connection Dialog

### 5. ✅ COMPLETED - MainWindow Integration
**File:** `src/gui/main_window.py`
- Already accepts pre-connected controller
- Properly transfers connection to ConnectionService

### 6. Add Progressive UI Updates
**File:** `src/gui/components/connection_dialog.py`
- Show devices as discovered during manual refresh
- Add "Scanning..." indicator with progress
- Allow cancellation of ongoing scan

### 7. ✅ COMPLETED - Device Cache
**File:** `config/.device_cache.json`
- Already has `last_arduino_port` field
- Consider adding cache for all device types (scales, etc.)

## Testing Checklist
- [ ] Single Arduino: Connects in <0.5s
- [ ] Multiple devices: All shown after background scan
- [ ] No Arduino: Falls back gracefully
- [ ] Port disconnect during scan: Handled properly
- [ ] Cache works across restarts
- [ ] UI updates progressively
