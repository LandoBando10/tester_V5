# Sequence Number Synchronization Fix

**Date:** 2025-01-01  
**Version:** Arduino Firmware v1.1.0, Python Controller v2.0.1

## Summary

Fixed sequence number synchronization issue between Python controller and Arduino firmware that was causing 27+ warning messages per test session.

## Changes Made

### Arduino Firmware (smt_tester.ino) - v1.1.0

1. **Modified `sendReliableResponse()` function:**
   - Changed from always auto-incrementing `globalSequenceNumber`
   - Now uses the received sequence number for command responses
   - Only auto-increments for events (button presses) that don't have a sequence
   - Maintains backward compatibility with CMDSEQ field

2. **Updated version number:**
   - Changed from v1.0.0 to v1.1.0

3. **Fixed RESET_SEQ command:**
   - Now properly uses received sequence in response

### Python Controller (smt_arduino_controller.py) - v2.0.1

1. **Added temporary sequence validation workaround:**
   - Accepts both expected sequence and expected+1
   - Logs at debug level instead of warning for expected+1 case
   - Added TODO comment to remove after firmware deployment
   - Only warns if sequence is truly unexpected

2. **Added documentation:**
   - Noted firmware version compatibility in connect() method
   - Added comments explaining the temporary workaround

## Deployment Instructions

### Phase 1: Deploy Python Update (Immediate)
1. Update Python controller code on all test stations
2. This will immediately reduce warnings from 27+ to near zero
3. System will work with both old (v1.0.x) and new (v1.1.0) firmware

### Phase 2: Deploy Arduino Firmware (Gradual)
1. Test new firmware on one Arduino first
2. Verify sequence numbers match exactly (no +1 offset)
3. Roll out to all test fixtures
4. Monitor logs for any issues

### Phase 3: Remove Python Workaround (Future)
1. After all Arduinos updated to v1.1.0+
2. Remove the temporary +1 acceptance logic
3. Return to strict sequence validation

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Verify RESET_SEQ command works correctly
- [ ] Test all panel measurement commands (TX:ALL, TX:1,2,3,4)
- [ ] Verify button events still work (EVENT:BUTTON_PRESSED)
- [ ] Check that sequence numbers now match exactly
- [ ] Confirm warning messages are eliminated
- [ ] Test with both old and new firmware versions

## Benefits

1. **Eliminates log noise:** No more sequence mismatch warnings
2. **Cleaner protocol:** Sequence numbers now properly synchronized
3. **Better debugging:** Real issues no longer hidden in warning spam
4. **Backward compatible:** Works with existing firmware during transition

## Notes

- The Arduino's `globalSequenceNumber` is now only used for events without sequences
- The CMDSEQ field is maintained for backward compatibility but is now redundant
- Future firmware could remove CMDSEQ to simplify the protocol
