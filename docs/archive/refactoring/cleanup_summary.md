# Directory Cleanup Summary

## Date: 2024-01-29

### Actions Taken:

1. **Created new directories:**
   - `scripts/` - For setup and utility scripts
   - `docs/analysis/` - For analysis documents
   - `docs/archive/refactoring/` - For old refactored files
   - `config/spc/` - For SPC configuration
   - `firmware/arduino/` - For Arduino firmware

2. **Moved script files to `scripts/`:**
   - `DiodeTester.pyw` - Windows launcher without console
   - Any .bat and .vbs files that were in root

3. **Moved analysis documents to `docs/analysis/`:**
   - `STARTUP_ANALYSIS.md`
   - `serial_port_scanning_performance_analysis.md`
   - `unused_code_analysis_report.md`

4. **Archived old files to `docs/archive/refactoring/`:**
   - `connection_dialog_old.py` - Old version before service extraction

5. **Moved misplaced files:**
   - `smt_setup.log` → `logs/`
   - `spc/spc_config.py` → `config/spc/`
   - `spc/spec_deriver.py` → `config/spc/`

6. **Consolidated duplicate directories:**
   - Removed empty `test_results/` (kept `results/`)
   - Removed empty `spc/` after moving contents
   - Moved `Arduino_firmware/*.ino` → `firmware/arduino/`
   - Removed empty `Arduino_firmware/`

### Result:

The root directory is now much cleaner with only essential files:
- `main.py` - Main entry point
- `requirements.txt` - Dependencies
- Configuration directories
- Source code directories
- Documentation directories

This improves project maintainability and makes the structure more intuitive for developers.
