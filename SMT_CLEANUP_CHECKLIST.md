# SMT System Cleanup Checklist

**Generated**: 2025-06-17  
**Purpose**: Clean up technical debt while preserving well-architected SMT system

## Analysis Summary

The SMT system architecture is **well-designed** with appropriate separation of concerns:
- **smt_controller.py** - Business logic controller (relay mapping)
- **smt_test.py** - Test orchestration and sequence management  
- **smt_handler.py** - GUI event handling and workflow management
- **smt_worker.py** - Threading wrapper for background execution
- **smt_arduino_controller.py** - Hardware communication layer

**Issue**: Technical debt from over-engineering cycle (Phase 1 complex → Phase 2 simplified)  
**Solution**: Remove deprecated/duplicate files while keeping current architecture

---

## High Priority (Do First)

### ✅ 1. Verify No Code Dependencies
- [x] Search codebase for imports of files to be deleted
- [x] Check for any references to `smt_arduino_controller_simple.py`  
- [x] Check for any references to `smt_arduino_controller_backup.py`
- [x] Verify no test files depend on these modules

**Commands to run:**
```bash
grep -r "smt_arduino_controller_simple" src/
grep -r "smt_arduino_controller_backup" src/
grep -r "from.*smt_arduino_controller_simple" .
grep -r "import.*smt_arduino_controller_simple" .
```

### ✅ 2. Remove Duplicate Files
- [x] Delete `src/hardware/smt_arduino_controller_simple.py` (identical duplicate)
- [x] Confirm `src/hardware/smt_arduino_controller.py` remains as the single source

**Files to delete:**
- `src/hardware/smt_arduino_controller_simple.py`

### ✅ 3. Test System After Cleanup  
- [ ] Run SMT tests with a known working SKU
- [ ] Verify Arduino communication still works
- [ ] Test button functionality
- [ ] Check programming workflow (if applicable)

---

## Medium Priority (Do Second)

### ✅ 4. Remove Deprecated Backup Controller
- [x] Delete `src/hardware/smt_arduino_controller_backup.py` (1,023 line legacy version)
- [x] Document what features were removed in commit message

**Files to delete:**
- `src/hardware/smt_arduino_controller_backup.py`

**Features removed from backup version:**
- Threading and command queues
- CRC-16 validation
- Binary framing support
- Resource management
- Health monitoring
- Command throttling
- Comprehensive statistics

### ✅ 5. Audit Documentation References
- [x] Check for broken links to deleted .md files in `docs/`
- [x] Update any README files that reference removed components
- [x] Remove references to deleted protocol files in comments

**Deleted files to check references for:**
- `src/protocols/binary_protocol.py`
- `src/protocols/framed_binary_protocol.py`
- `src/protocols/protocol_manager.py`
- Various deleted documentation files

---

## Low Priority (Do When Time Permits)

### ✅ 6. Clean Arduino Firmware Archive
- [x] Review `Arduino_firmware/archive/` directory
- [x] Remove old firmware versions that are no longer relevant:
  - `Button_Test.ino` (already removed)
  - `SMT_Board_Tester.ino` (already removed)
  - `SMT_Board_Tester_Binary_v5.3.0.ino` (already removed)
  - `SMT_Board_Tester_with_Button.ino` (already removed)
- [x] Keep only versions needed for rollback/reference

### ✅ 7. Update Project Documentation
- [x] Document current simplified architecture in `docs/project-overview.md`
- [x] Create brief migration notes explaining the Phase 1 → Phase 2 simplification
- [x] Update any developer onboarding docs to reflect current structure

---

## Validation Checklist

After completing cleanup:

- [ ] ✅ System builds without errors
- [ ] ✅ SMT tests execute successfully  
- [ ] ✅ No broken imports or missing dependencies
- [ ] ✅ Arduino communication works correctly
- [ ] ✅ Button events are handled properly
- [ ] ✅ Programming workflow functions (if enabled)
- [ ] ✅ All test modes work as expected

---

## Files to Keep (Do NOT Delete)

### Core Architecture (Keep)
- ✅ `src/core/smt_controller.py`
- ✅ `src/core/smt_test.py` 
- ✅ `src/gui/handlers/smt_handler.py`
- ✅ `src/gui/workers/smt_worker.py`
- ✅ `src/hardware/smt_arduino_controller.py`
- ✅ `src/gui/components/smt_widget.py`

### Current Firmware (Keep)
- ✅ `Arduino_firmware/SMT_Board_Tester_with_Button_v5.4.3.ino`
- ✅ `Arduino_firmware/SMT_Simple_Tester.ino`

### Supporting Files (Keep)
- ✅ `src/utils/smt_setup_utility.py`
- ✅ `docs/smt_workflow_description.md`
- ✅ All SKU configuration files with SMT settings

## Notes

- Current architecture is **well-designed** - do not restructure
- Focus only on removing technical debt, not changing functionality
- Test thoroughly after each deletion
- Document any issues encountered during cleanup

**Architecture Verdict**: ✅ **Keep current 5-component structure** - it's appropriately layered for a production testing system.
