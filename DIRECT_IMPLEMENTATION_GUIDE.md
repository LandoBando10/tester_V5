# Configuration Editor - Direct Implementation (No Adapter)

## What This Does
Updates the GUI configuration editor components to work directly with your existing SKU JSON file format. No format conversion, no adapter - just direct file operations.

## Updated Components

### 1. `sku_editor.py`
- Works with `pod_type` and `power_level` (not `pod_type_ref`, `power_level_ref`)
- Extracts backlight info from test sequences
- Saves back in your exact format

### 2. `test_selector.py`
- Works with `offroad_testing`, `smt_testing`, `weight_testing` sections
- Detects which measurements are used in test sequences
- Updates test sequences directly

### 3. `parameter_editor.py`
- Dynamically creates UI based on your test_sequence structure
- Edits limits directly in the test sequences
- No reorganization of parameters

### 4. `config_editor.py`
- Loads SKU files directly from `config/skus/`
- No format conversion
- Saves back in exact same structure

## Key Benefits
- **No Adapter Needed** - Removes unnecessary complexity
- **Direct File Operations** - What you see is what's in the file
- **Preserves Your Format** - Files remain exactly as they are
- **Simple and Clean** - Easy to understand and maintain

## Implementation Steps

1. **Replace the GUI components** with the updated versions
2. **Delete `format_adapter.py`** - it's not needed
3. **Test with your existing SKU files** - they should load and save correctly

## How It Works

When you load `SL0224P01-ABL.json`:
```json
{
  "pod_type": "SS3",
  "smt_testing": {
    "test_sequence": [
      {
        "function": "mainbeam",
        "limits": {
          "current_A": { "min": 0.95, "max": 1.2 }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

The GUI:
- Shows "SS3" in the pod type dropdown (not looking for pod_type_ref)
- Creates parameter inputs for the exact limits in your test_sequence
- Saves back in the same structure

## Summary
This approach respects your existing file format and removes unnecessary complexity. The GUI works directly with your files as they are, making the system simpler and more maintainable.
