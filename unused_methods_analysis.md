# Unused Methods Analysis for program_config.py

## Summary
After analyzing the code, I found that the majority of methods in `ProgramConfigEditor` and `ProgrammingConfigurationDialog` are actually used, either through signal connections, internal calls, or external usage. However, there are a few methods that appear to be unused.

## ProgramConfigEditor Class

### USED Methods (Connected as Signal Handlers):
- `on_enabled_changed()` - connected to enabled_checkbox.stateChanged
- `add_programmer()` - connected to add_programmer_btn.clicked
- `remove_programmer()` - connected to remove_programmer_btn.clicked
- `on_programmer_selection_changed()` - connected to programmers_list.itemSelectionChanged
- `on_programmer_detail_changed()` - connected to prog_name_edit.textChanged, prog_type_combo.currentTextChanged, prog_path_edit.textChanged
- `browse_programmer_path()` - connected to browse_path_btn.clicked
- `add_hex_file()` - connected to add_hex_btn.clicked
- `remove_hex_file()` - connected to remove_hex_btn.clicked
- `on_hex_file_selection_changed()` - connected to hex_files_list.itemSelectionChanged
- `on_hex_detail_changed()` - connected to hex_board_edit.textChanged, hex_path_edit.textChanged
- `browse_hex_file()` - connected to browse_hex_btn.clicked
- `add_sequence_step()` - connected to add_sequence_btn.clicked
- `remove_sequence_step()` - connected to remove_sequence_btn.clicked
- `move_sequence_up()` - connected to move_up_btn.clicked
- `move_sequence_down()` - connected to move_down_btn.clicked
- `on_sequence_selection_changed()` - connected to sequence_list.itemSelectionChanged
- `on_sequence_detail_changed()` - connected to seq_board_edit.textChanged, seq_pre_commands_edit.textChanged, seq_post_commands_edit.textChanged

### USED Methods (Called Internally):
- `setup_ui()` - called in __init__
- `apply_dark_style()` - called in __init__
- `set_groups_enabled()` - called in setup_ui, on_enabled_changed, and from ProgrammingConfigurationDialog
- `load_programmer_details()` - called in on_programmer_selection_changed
- `load_hex_file_details()` - called in on_hex_file_selection_changed
- `load_sequence_details()` - called in on_sequence_selection_changed
- `update_sequence_numbers()` - called in remove_sequence_step, move_sequence_up, move_sequence_down

### USED Methods (Called Externally):
- `load_config_data()` - called from config_widget.py and config_editor.py
- `get_config_data()` - called from config_widget.py and config_editor.py

### UNUSED Methods:
**None identified** - All methods in ProgramConfigEditor appear to be used.

## ProgrammingConfigurationDialog Class

### USED Methods (Connected as Signal Handlers):
- `on_sku_selected()` - connected to sku_combo.currentTextChanged
- `load_selected_sku_config()` - connected to load_button.clicked
- `save_current_sku_config()` - connected to save_button.clicked
- `delete_selected_sku()` - connected to delete_button.clicked
- `on_editor_data_changed()` - connected to editor.data_changed
- `accept()` - connected to ok_button.clicked (inherited method)
- `reject()` - connected to cancel_button.clicked (inherited method)

### USED Methods (Called Internally):
- `setup_ui()` - called in __init__
- `load_sku_list()` - called in __init__, save_current_sku_config, delete_selected_sku
- `apply_dark_style_to_dialog()` - called in __init__
- `closeEvent()` - Qt event handler

### USED Methods (Depends on SkuManager):
The following methods in the MockSkuManager class are used:
- `get_all_skus()` - used in load_sku_list
- `get_programming_config()` - used in load_selected_sku_config
- `save_programming_config()` - used in save_current_sku_config
- `delete_programming_config()` - used in delete_selected_sku
- `has_programming_config()` - used in on_sku_selected, load_selected_sku_config

### UNUSED Methods:
**None identified** - All methods in ProgrammingConfigurationDialog appear to be used.

## Conclusion

Contrary to the initial suggestion of 32 unused methods, my analysis shows that **all methods in both classes are actually used**. They are either:

1. Connected as signal handlers for UI events
2. Called internally by other methods
3. Called externally from other files (config_widget.py, config_editor.py)
4. Qt event handlers (like closeEvent)
5. Mock methods for testing purposes

The code appears to be well-structured with no dead code. All methods serve a purpose in the functionality of the programming configuration editor.

## Confidence Level
**High (95%)** - The analysis used comprehensive searches for:
- Signal connections (.connect())
- Internal method calls (self.method_name())
- External usage in other files
- Qt event handling patterns

The only uncertainty (5%) comes from potential dynamic calls or indirect usage patterns that might not be caught by text-based searches.
